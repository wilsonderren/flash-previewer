# flash-previewer
Uses PHP to create a preview page for a folder of flash and animated gif ads

## how it works
download the files to your local webserver. Put your gif and swf files in the 'put-ads-here' folder, then go to preview.php in your web browser.

## testing your click tag code
Change the 'Flash click tag variable name' field to match what you've been asked to create in Flash, and then the flash movies should redirect you to the Test URI.
